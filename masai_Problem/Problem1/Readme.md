* Basically we are doing crud using FS module and yargs library used for cli purpose to parse the  command line arguments
* In Yargs we get command method from which we should be able to execute the command line arguments and return the result as a string with the command method applied to the command line arguments using handler and FS module
* It's an easy way to parse the command line arguments and use with argv passed as an argument to the command and extract the data from the command line arguments.
